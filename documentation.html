    <h1>Fake News Detection - Documentation</h1>

    <p>This is the official documentation for the Fake News Detection system. It includes guidelines on how to use the system effectively, along with technical details about the dataset, model architecture, and other system components.</p>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>To begin using the Fake News Detection system, follow these simple steps:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Visit the homepage and navigate to the 'Upload' section to submit a news article.</li>
        <li>The system will analyze the text and provide a real-time prediction on whether the content is likely to be fake or not.</li>
        <li>Use the 'About' section to learn more about the origins and development of the system.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>System Architecture</h2>
    <p>The Fake News Detection system is built using a robust machine learning model that has been trained on a diverse dataset of news articles. Key components include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong> Text data is cleaned and preprocessed to remove noise and standardize the input for modeling.</li>
        <li><strong>Model Training:</strong> The system uses a combination of natural language processing techniques and deep learning algorithms to understand and predict the authenticity of news content.</li>
        <li><strong>API Integration:</strong> The system is integrated with a user-friendly web interface that allows easy submission and retrieval of news article analyses.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Technical Specifications</h2>
    <p>Detailed specifications of the model and its performance metrics are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Model Type:</strong> The core algorithm is based on a neural network that specializes in text analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> The current model achieves an accuracy of approximately 92% on a validated test set.</li>
        <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Designed to scale efficiently with increased load, ensuring consistent performance even under heavy user traffic.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
    <p>Here are some common questions about the Fake News Detection system:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Is the system free to use?</strong> Yes, the Fake News Detection system is free for personal use.</li>
        <li><strong>How can I support the development of this system?</strong> Contributions to development or suggestions for improvement are always welcome. Please visit the 'About' page for contact information.</li>
        <li><strong>Can the system detect bias in news?</strong> While the primary focus is on detecting outright fake news, efforts are underway to enhance the system's ability to detect biased content.</li>
    </ul>
